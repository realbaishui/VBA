In this code:

We define a set exclude_words containing the words you want to exclude from the output.

When counting word frequency and printing the output, we check if each word is in the exclude_words set. If it's not in the set, we include it in the output.

With this modification, the code will exclude the specified words from the word frequency output:

makefile
Copy code
parentheses: 1
another: 1
test: 1
apples: 1
oranges: 1
In this example, "is" and "and" have been excluded from the output. You can customize the exclude_words set to include any words you want to exclude.
